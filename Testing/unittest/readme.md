# 📝 Text Capitalizer — Simple Python Project

A beginner-friendly Python project that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string and tests the function using Python’s built-in `unittest` framework.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `cap.py`  
  Defines the `cap_text()` function to capitalize each word in a given string.

- `test_cap.py`  
  Contains unit tests for the `cap_text()` function using `unittest`.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The input string is split into words.
2. Each word's first character is capitalized.
3. The words are rejoined into a single string.
4. The behavior is tested through different test cases.

## 🧪 Test Cases

- Capitalizing a single word.
- Capitalizing multiple words.
- Handling words with apostrophes.

## 📚 Learning Highlights

- Writing clean, testable Python functions.
- Performing basic string manipulation.
- Creating and running unit tests using `unittest`.
